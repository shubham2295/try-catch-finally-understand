# 📚 Practical Object-Oriented Design — Code & Notes

> **A TypeScript journey through "Practical Object-Oriented Design" by Sandi Metz**  
> _Because great code isn't just written — it's designed._

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo tracks my reading, reflections, and code experiments while working through **Practical Object-Oriented Design** (POODR).  
Each chapter comes with:

- 📖 A short TL;DR summary
- 💬 Key concepts and memorable quotes
- 🛠️ A custom **TypeScript toolkit addition** inspired by the chapter
- 🎯 Mini coding challenges and refactor exercises

## 🛠️ How This Repo Works

Each chapter has its own markdown file and related code samples:

```

```

Each **Toolkit Addition** is a real, reusable piece of code inspired by POODR principles, adapted for TypeScript.

---

## ✨ Goals

- 📚 Deeply understand object-oriented design, not just at a surface level.
- 🛠️ Create a personal TypeScript "Design Toolkit" along the way.
- 🤔 Ask better questions about code quality and flexibility.
- 📈 Evolve coding habits to naturally write more flexible, resilient code.
